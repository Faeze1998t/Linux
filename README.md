## About This Repository

Hi everyone i am faeze and i design This repository to help beginners learn Linux from the ground up. Whether you're preparing for a career in IT, system administration, or just want to understand this powerful operating system, this guide will walk you through essential concepts and commands.

## What is Linux?

Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel that forms the base for various operating system distributions (distros). It's known for its:

- Stability and reliability
- Security features
- Flexibility and customization
- Free and open-source nature
- Strong command-line interface
- Wide use in servers, cloud computing, and embedded systems

## Key Linux Concepts

### 1. The Linux Filesystem Hierarchy
- `/` - Root directory
- `/bin` - Essential user binaries
- `/etc` - Configuration files
- `/home` - User home directories
- `/var` - Variable data files

### 2. Basic Commands
- File operations: `ls`, `cd`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`
- File viewing: `cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail`
- System info: `uname`, `df`, `free`, `top`
- Process management: `ps`, `kill`, `bg`, `fg`

### 3. File Permissions
- Three permission types: read (r), write (w), execute (x)
- Three user classes: owner, group, others
- Changed with `chmod` and `chown` commands

### 4. Package Management
- Debian-based (APT): `apt-get`, `apt`, `dpkg`
- Red Hat-based (RPM): `yum`, `dnf`, `rpm`
- Arch-based: `pacman`

### 5. Shell Scripting
- Writing and executing shell scripts
- Variables, conditionals, loops
- Automating tasks

### 6. User Management
- Adding/removing users: `useradd`, `userdel`
- Managing groups: `groupadd`, `groupdel`
- Password management: `passwd`

### 7. Networking
- Basic commands: `ping`, `ifconfig`/`ip`, `netstat`, `ssh`
- Firewall management: `iptables`, `ufw`
