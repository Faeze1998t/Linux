## 1\. What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to build, ship, and run applications in a consistent and isolated manner using "containers." Containers are lightweight, portable, self-sufficient units that package an application and all its dependencies (libraries, frameworks, configurations) together.

### Containers vs. Virtual Machines (VMs)

While both containers and VMs provide isolation, they differ significantly in their architecture:

  * **Virtual Machines (VMs):** Each VM includes a full guest operating system (OS) on top of the host OS and a hypervisor. This makes them relatively heavy and slower to start.
  * **Containers:** Containers share the host OS kernel and only package the application and its dependencies. This makes them much lighter, faster to start, and more efficient in resource usage.

\</p\>

### Why Use Docker?

  * **Consistency:** "Build once, run anywhere." Docker ensures your application runs identically across different environments (development, testing, production).
  * **Isolation:** Applications and their dependencies are isolated from each other and the host system, preventing conflicts.
  * **Portability:** Containers can be easily moved and deployed across any Docker-enabled environment.
  * **Efficiency:** Lighter than VMs, leading to faster startup times and better resource utilization.
  * **Scalability:** Easily scale up or down applications by launching or stopping containers.

-----

## 2\. Prerequisites

To follow along with this guide and run Docker commands, you need to have **Docker Desktop** installed on your system. Docker Desktop includes everything you need: Docker Engine, Docker CLI, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes.

  * **Download Docker Desktop:** [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

After installation, open your terminal (or Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows) and verify Docker is running by typing:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version # If you have Docker Compose V2, otherwise 'docker-compose --version' for V1
```

-----

## 3\. Core Docker Concepts

Understanding these key terms is crucial for working with Docker:

### Images

A Docker **Image** is a read-only template that contains an application and all its dependencies. Think of it as a blueprint or a class in object-oriented programming. Images are built from a `Dockerfile`.

### Containers

A Docker **Container** is a runnable instance of a Docker Image. It's the actual running application with its isolated environment. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container.

### Dockerfile

A **Dockerfile** is a text file that contains a set of instructions for building a Docker Image. It's like a recipe for creating your application's environment.

### Volumes

**Volumes** are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by Docker containers. They allow data to survive container deletion and facilitate sharing data between containers and the host system.

### Networks

Docker **Networks** enable communication between Docker containers, and also between containers and the outside world. Docker creates default networks, but you can also define custom ones for better isolation and communication.

### Docker Compose

**Docker Compose** is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. You use a YAML file (`docker-compose.yml`) to configure your application's services, networks, and volumes, and then you can spin up the entire application stack with a single command.

## 4\. Basic Docker Commands

Let's get hands-on with some essential Docker CLI commands:

  * **`docker pull <image_name>[:<tag>]`**: Downloads an image from Docker Hub (the default registry). If no tag is specified, it pulls the `latest` tag.

    ```bash
    docker pull ubuntu:22.04
    docker pull nginx
    ```

  * **`docker images`**: Lists all images downloaded on your local machine.

    ```bash
    docker images
    ```

  * **`docker run [OPTIONS] <image_name> [COMMAND] [ARG...]`**: Creates and starts a new container from an image.

      * `-d` (detached mode): Runs the container in the background.
      * `-p <host_port>:<container_port>`: Maps a port from the container to a port on your host machine.
      * `--name <container_name>`: Assigns a custom name to your container.
      * `-it` (interactive TTY): Attaches an interactive terminal to the container (useful for shells).
      * `-v <host_path>:<container_path>`: Mounts a volume (bind mount) from your host to the container.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    # Run a simple busybox container and print "Hello Docker!"
    docker run busybox echo "Hello Docker!"

    # Run Nginx web server in detached mode, mapping host port 8080 to container port 80
    docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my-nginx nginx

    # Run an interactive Ubuntu shell
    docker run -it ubuntu bash
    ```

  * **`docker ps`**: Lists running containers. Add `-a` to list all containers (running and stopped).

    ```bash
    docker ps
    docker ps -a
    ```

  * **`docker stop <container_name_or_id>`**: Stops a running container.

    ```bash
    docker stop my-nginx
    ```

  * **`docker start <container_name_or_id>`**: Starts a stopped container.

    ```bash
    docker start my-nginx
    ```

  * **`docker restart <container_name_or_id>`**: Restarts a running or stopped container.

    ```bash
    docker restart my-nginx
    ```

  * **`docker rm <container_name_or_id>`**: Removes one or more stopped containers.

    ```bash
    docker rm my-nginx
    # Remove all stopped containers
    docker container prune
    ```

  * **`docker rmi <image_name_or_id>`**: Removes one or more images.

    ```bash
    docker rmi nginx
    # Remove all dangling images (not associated with any container)
    docker image prune
    ```

  * **`docker exec -it <container_name_or_id> <command>`**: Executes a command inside a running container.

    ```bash
    docker exec -it my-nginx bash # Get a shell inside the Nginx container
    ```

  * **`docker logs <container_name_or_id>`**: Fetches the logs of a container. Add `-f` to stream logs.

    ```bash
    docker logs my-nginx
    docker logs -f my-nginx # Follow logs
    ```

-----

## 5\. Working with Dockerfiles

A `Dockerfile` is a script that automates the process of creating a Docker image. Let's create a simple Python application and build an image for it.

**Example: Simple Python Flask App**

1.  Create a directory for your project:

    ```bash
    mkdir my-flask-app
    cd my-flask-app
    ```

2.  Create an `app.py` file:

    ```python
    # app.py
    from flask import Flask

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def hello_world():
        return 'Hello, Docker! This is a Flask app.'

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
    ```

3.  Create a `requirements.txt` file:

    ```
    Flask==2.3.2
    ```

4.  Create a `Dockerfile` in the same directory:

    ```dockerfile
    # Dockerfile
    # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
    FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

    # Set the working directory in the container
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
    COPY requirements.txt .
    COPY app.py .

    # Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

    # Make port 5000 available to the world outside this container
    EXPOSE 5000

    # Define environment variable
    ENV NAME World

    # Run app.py when the container launches
    CMD ["python", "app.py"]
    ```

5.  **Build the Docker Image:**
    In your terminal, navigate to the `my-flask-app` directory and run:

    ```bash
    docker build -t my-flask-app:1.0 .
    # -t: Tag the image with a name and version (e.g., my-flask-app:1.0)
    # .: Context for the build (current directory)
    ```

6.  **Run the Container from your new Image:**

    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name flask-web-app my-flask-app:1.0
    ```

7.  **Access the app:** Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`.

## 6\. Docker Compose Basics

Docker Compose is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to configure application services.

**Example: Nginx + Simple HTML Page**

1.  Create a new directory:

    ```bash
    mkdir docker-compose-nginx
    cd docker-compose-nginx
    ```

2.  Create an `html` directory and an `index.html` file inside it:

    ```bash
    mkdir html
    echo "<h1>Welcome to Nginx on Docker Compose!</h1>" > html/index.html
    ```

3.  Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the `docker-compose-nginx` directory:

    ```yaml
    # docker-compose.yml
    version: '3.8'

    services:
      web:
        image: nginx:latest
        container_name: my_nginx_server
        ports:
          - "80:80" # Map host port 80 to container port 80
        volumes:
          - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro # Mount local html folder to Nginx's web root (read-only)
        restart: always
    ```

4.  **Start the application:**
    In the `docker-compose-nginx` directory, run:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d # Or docker-compose up -d for older versions
    ```

5.  **Access the Nginx server:** Open your browser and go to `http://localhost`.

6.  **Stop and remove the application:**

    ```bash
    docker compose down # Or docker-compose down
    ```
